# **BMPuzzle**

**BMPuzzle** is a command-line tool that transforms BMP images into puzzles and allows you to solve them. 

The core idea is to split the image into blocks, shuffle them according to a sequence generated from a **secret**, and then use the same secret to reconstruct the original image.

## **How it works**

1. The image is divided into square blocks.
2. The blocks are shuffled following an order derived from a secret (a key/seed).
3. To rebuild the image, you need to provide the same secret: this ensures that the blocks are placed back in their original position.

## **Block size selection**

The block size cannot be arbitrary: it must be a divisor of both the image width and height.

For example, if the image is 800Ã—600 pixels, valid block sizes could be 20, 50, 100, etc., as long as they evenly divide both width and height.

If a non-compatible size is chosen, the process does not work correctly.

**Note**: the block size must be specified both when generating the puzzle and when solving it.

Below is an example of the tool's application.

## **Generate a Puzzle**

In this example, we use the image `lena.bmp` with dimensions **1200x800**. A valid block size is **300x200**.

```bash

./bmpuzzle generator --input lena.bmp --output puzzles/300x200.bmp --secret 1234567890 --block-size 300x200

```

## **Solve a Puzzle**

First, solve the puzzle using the correct secret.

```bash

./bmpuzzle solver --input puzzles/300x200.bmp --output results/300x200.bmp --secret 1234567890 --block-size 300x200

```

Whereas, if the key used for solving does not match the one used for generation, the puzzle will be shuffled.
