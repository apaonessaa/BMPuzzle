# BMPuzzle

**BMPuzzle** is a command-line tool that transforms BMP images into puzzles and allows you to solve them. 

The core idea is to split the image into blocks, shuffle them according to a sequence generated from a **secret**, and then use the same secret to reconstruct the original image.

  <img width="640" height="214" alt="puzzle" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5cb54e8-b783-4177-8150-606861fd46b4" />

### How it works

1. The image is divided into square blocks.
2. The blocks are shuffled following an order derived from a secret (a key/seed).
3. To rebuild the image, you need to provide the same secret: this ensures that the blocks are placed back in their original position.

### Block size selection

The block size cannot be arbitrary: it must be a divisor of both the image width and height.

For example, if the image is 800Ã—600 pixels, valid block sizes could be 20, 50, 100, etc., as long as they evenly divide both width and height.

If a non-compatible size is chosen, the process does not work.

**Note**: the block size must be specified both when generating the puzzle and when solving it.

### Usage

```text

bmpuzzle mode [-h] -i INPUT -o OUTPUT -s SECRET [-b BLOCK_SIZE] [-d]

Modes:
    generator
    solver

Flags:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        Source Image filename
  
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Output Image filename
  
  -s SECRET, --secret SECRET
                        Secret value (integer value)
  
  -b BLOCK_SIZE, --block-size BLOCK_SIZE
                        Block size in pixels, format 'widthxheight' (must evenly divide the image size)
  
  -d, --debug           Debug

```

### Generate a Puzzle

```bash

./bmpuzzle generator --input [source image] --output [output image] --secret [secret value] --block-size <block size [widthxheight]>

```

An example:

```bash

./bmpuzzle generator --input images/lena.bmp --output puzzles/100x100.bmp --secret 1234567890 --block-size 100x100

```

### Solve a Puzzle

```bash

./bmpuzzle solver --input [source image] --output [output image] --secret [secret value] --block-size <block size [widthxheight]>

```

An example:

```bash

./bmpuzzle solver --input puzzles/100x100.bmp --output results/100x100.bmp --secret 1234567890 --block-size 100x100

```

### Tests

The secret used to generate the puzzles in the folder with the same name is `1234567890`.

### TODO

- DEBUG info
- Data validation
